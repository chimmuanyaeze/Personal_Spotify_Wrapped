# Background
This is a hobby project that I got into because I couldn't find my favourite podcast on spotify again,, maybe it was deleted or maybe it was removed from my location
So i had to download the spotify extended listening history to look for it. After finding in it in the heap of json data, I thought to myself why not make my own spotify wrapped
## The Ultimate spotify wrapped 
### I wanted a simple project with:
1. NO cost
2. No Spotfy API
3. No license issues
4. No legal squable
5. Just a hobbiest tool
6. Protected user data

So i decided to just use the JSON data directly and whoever is trying to use it should so it's your data so you have the right to do whatever you want with it

## TOOLS
1. django
2. css
3. javscript
4. html
5. and of course python

## APPROACH
User has to request for their spotify extended (which might take up to 48 hrs to be sent to your email) 
Download the data 
upload the data to the site 
then your wrapped comes in

## For COllaborators
1. I didn't add a choice to create a secific years wrapped it just returns your all time wrapped ( I might work on it but at the moment anyone can)
2. Cool animations that is specified to ones favourite genre of music
3. Specific notes to people based on their wrapped
4. The generation the persson fits into e.g Gen Z, Gen Alpha, Millenial
5. Any other cool feature will be vetted and added and we go

## Final Note
I am not expecting any collaborators or pull or anything big or to change the world or a new LINUX community from this project I am just happy to have gone this far and I was happy to see my wrapped.
my top songs of all time and total playtime
my top 10 podcast of all and playtime
my most skipped plays of all time
and the many stats i saw that was good enough for me.
But I am queitly hoping for a collaborator that will improve on it as specified above and more it would be nice
